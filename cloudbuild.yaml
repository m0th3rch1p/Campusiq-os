steps:
  # Step 1: Build the image using the Dockerfile
  # We use the standard docker cloud-builder.
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    id: 'Build Docker Image'
    args: 
      - 'build'
      - '-t'
      - '$_AR_HOSTNAME/$PROJECT_ID/$_REPO_NAME/$_IMAGE_NAME:$COMMIT_SHA'
      - '.'

  # Step 2: Push the image to the registry
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    id: 'Push Image'
    args: 
      - 'push'
      - '$_AR_HOSTNAME/$PROJECT_ID/$_REPO_NAME/$_IMAGE_NAME:$COMMIT_SHA'

# --- THE FIX IS HERE ---
options:
  # explicit logging configuration satisfies the service account requirement
  logging: CLOUD_LOGGING_ONLY 

# Substitutions allow you to pass variables at build time.
# Defaults are provided here, but you should override them in your Trigger settings.
substitutions:
  _AR_HOSTNAME: 'us-central1-docker.pkg.dev' # Change to your region/registry
  _REPO_NAME: 'my-repo'                      # Change to your Artifact Registry repo
  _IMAGE_NAME: 'my-vite-app'                 # Your image name
